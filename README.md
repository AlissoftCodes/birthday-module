# Birthday-Module
This is a simple Python module to help dealing with birthdate-based calculations.


Examples:

# Let's calculate the age of someone who was born in September 27th of 1984
# The method format is the integer values for day, month and year
# The current date is April 10th of 2023

# Let's import the module

>>>from birthday_module import *
>>>
>>>get_age(27, 9, 1984)
>>>38
# So we had the integer value of 38 as the output.
# Let's see how many days from that date until the current date.
>>>get_days(27, 9, 1984)
>>>14075
# And we had the integer value of 14075 as the output.
# In order to see all the available functions and their descriptions, you can import the module and run the command help(birthday_module).
